# Vector Databases and Milvus Exploration

This project documents a learning journey into the world of vector databases, focusing on their ability to encode and store complex information as numerical feature vectors for semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

## Summary of Learning

Through this exploration, I learned several key concepts, technologies and use cases:

-   **Vector Encoding:** Representation of rich data (text, images, etc.) as ordered lists of numbers, where each value corresponds to a specific property or dimension.
-   **Vector Database Technologies:** Understanding how specialised databases, such as Milvus, store and efficiently search feature vectors to enable similarity search across large datasets.
-   **Semantic Search & RAG:** Applying vector-based retrieval to power applications like semantic search (finding meaningfully related content) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (enhancing generative AI answers with retrieved external knowledge).
-   **Milvus Use Cases:** Hands-on work with Milvus, an open-source vector database, investigating its strengths in scale, performance, and integration for AI applications.
-   **ANNS (Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search):** Studying and practicing algorithms designed for rapid, approximate similarity search, which make realtime AI applications possible even with massive, high-dimensional data.

### Core Learning Outcomes

-   Developed practical skills in encoding and storing data as vectors for advanced querying.
-   Explored how vector databases underpin cutting-edge semantic search and RAG workflows.
-   Gained familiarity with Milvus and key ANNS algorithms, understanding their roles in real-world projects.

I am excited and eager to apply the skills and knowledge gained from this exploration to real-world projects leveraging vector databases, semantic search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to create impactful, modern AI-driven solutions.
